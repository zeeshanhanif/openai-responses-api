# OpenAI Responses API & Chat API Comparison Repository

This repository explores the differences between OpenAI's new **Responses API** and the existing **Chat API**, providing practical, side-by-side examples in each Jupyter notebook.  
It aims to help developers understand the enhanced functionality, flexibility, and multi-turn interaction capabilities of the Responses API while comparing it with the familiar Chat API.

## Overview

OpenAI's Responses API simplifies the development of agentic applications by supporting:
- **Multi-turn conversations**  
- **Multiple tool integrations** like Web Search, File Search, and Computer Use  
- **Structured and streaming outputs**  

This API reduces the complexity of manually integrating tools and conversational logic, making it easier to build advanced AI-driven applications.

Each Jupyter notebook in this repository includes:
1. **Chat API Example**  
   Traditional usage of OpenAI's Chat API for comparison.
2. **Responses API Example**  
   Demonstrates how the same task can be accomplished using the new Responses API, highlighting the key differences and improvements.
